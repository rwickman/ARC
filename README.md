# ARC
#### *Autonomous R/C Car*
## What is it?
It is an autonomous vehicle that utilizes behavior cloning and object recognition to naviagate around a track! It is also able to perform customized actions based upon the object that it detects.
## How to make updates
Currently to reflect the changes in this repository to the donkeycar library, you have to copy/replace the files over to the /home/pi/env/lib/python3.5/site-packages/donkeycar directory(this will be fixed in the future).
